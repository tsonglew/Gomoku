### Attention:

 * Clone this repository and input `python main.py` in the terminal or console to start.
 * If your window for the terminal or console is not big enough, you may come
   across `_curses.error: addstr() returned ERR`. Turning for a fullscreen will
   help.
 * 'X' represents Player1 who goes first, and then comes Player2 with 'O'.
 * Question mark('?') represents the point you are on, and you could press 'C'
   to set a chessman on this point.
 * Press 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' to move your question mark.
 * After you set a chessman, the question mark will be covered by it. Use the
   direction marks to move the question mark and you will see it again.
 * Press 'R' to start over.
 * Press 'Q' to return to your terminal or console.
